Natural Language Processing<br>
---------------------------
Codes, datasets, and explanations for some basic natural language tasks and models. <br>

This repository is a set of 5 tutorials which provide a basic knowledge about NLP, and applying it to text to get results without needing a deep mathematical knowledge of the working behind the models. NLTK, Keras and scikit-learn are the main libraries used in the tutorials. Each folder contains the datasets and a Jupyter Notebook for that tutorial. I've also written detailed Medium tutorials to explain the code in the Notebooks, which are linked below. <br>

1. NLP Preprocessing <br>
Explains the basic preprocessing tasks to be performed before training almost any model. Covers stemming and lemmatization and their differences. <br>

2. Language Modeling <br>
Building and studying statistical language models from a corpus dataset. Unigram, bigram, trigram and fourgram models are covered. <br>

3. Classifier Models <br>
Building and comparing the accuracy of Naive Bayes and LSTM models on a given dataset using NLTK and Keras. <br>

4. Conditional Random Fields <br>
Experimenting with POS tagging, a standard sequence labeling task using CRFs with the help of the scikit-learn crfsuite wrapper. <br>

5. Word and Character Based LSTM Models <br>
Building and analyzing word and character based LSTM models. Two different character based models are also trained and compared. <br>
